   Open the `data/plugins-and-themes.yml` file and add your plugin or theme in the appropriate section:
   - Add plugin entries under the `plugins:` section.

   Follow the format used in existing entries. Each entry must include:
   - `name`

   - `description`
   - `creator`:
     - `name`
     - `url`
     - `avatar`

   If it fails, visit the **Actions** tab to view the error details and fix any issues.

> [!TIP]  
> If everything is correct, the markdown files (`PLUGINS.md`, `THEMES.md`, and `README.md`) will be automatically updated on merge.

> [!NOTE]  
> You no longer need to manually validate YAML â€” it's automatically handled by `validate-yml.py` and checked via GitHub Actions.
